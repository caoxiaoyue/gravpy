Welcome!

This project is a Python implementation of the general lens solver GravLens. 

To run the program, execute the 'grid.py' file.

At this current version, this project does the following:
* Take the magnification function for a Single Isothermal Sphere (SIE) and compute the transformation of coordinates from the image plane to the source plane.
* Subgridding around the magnification function.
* Given a point in the source plane, find the exact position(s) in the image plane.
