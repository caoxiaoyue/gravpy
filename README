Welcome!

This project is a Python implementation of the general lens solver GravLens. 

To run the program, execute the 'run_timer.py' file.

At this current version, this project does the following:
* Take the magnification function for given model(s) and compute the transformation of coordinates from the image plane to the source plane.
* Given a point in the source plane, find the exact position(s) in the image plane. 

Supported Models:
Alpha = 0 (Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid)

Models that are not fully functional in this version:
Alpha = -1 (Plummer Model)

Make sure to install these libraries before running!
Dependencies:
SciPy
---NumPy
---matplotlib
mlab
pycallgraph (this library can be excluded if you are not interested in seeing runtimes, make sure to comment out the relevant section in `run_timer.py`)
